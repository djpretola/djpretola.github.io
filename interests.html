<p>My personal interests revolve around computers. Since I was young, I have been fascinated by what can be accomplished by them. Since I am a Software Engineer, I have focused on the building of software. I want to build software systems that are effective, reliable and extendible allowing its user to accomplish their own goals. 
<p>Engineering is the obvious methodology to accomplish this objective. I view the work of Software Engineers as controlling complexity and specifically maintaining this control through constant change in technology and requirements. Unlike a Mechanical Engineer, whom applies continuous mathematics, physics and materials for mechanical systems; a Software Engineer applies discrete mathematics, logic and electronics for information systems. 
<p>Computer Programming is the means to implementing this methodology. There are many programming paradigms, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming">imperative</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object oriented</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional</a> to name and few, and all have their strengths and weaknesses when applied. Determining which methodology works the best for a particular set of requirements and containing the ensuing complexity is the job of the Software Engineer. I am actively pursuing knowledge and skills in this domain.
<p>To be more concrete in my interest in computers, I am interested in autonomous systems and the challenges they provide in robotics, artificial intelligence and society as a whole. I like software systems that have the ability to directly effect the world around them, without a direct dependence on people, such as robotics, and SCADA systems. I find software that does more then simply compute data into information and then store that information with the reliance on a person using it to effect the world, fascinating.
<p>Additionally, I am interested in <a href="http://www.esri.com/what-is-gis">GIS</a> and the ability to model spatial information and gain new insight into the real world. This interest allows me to link the natural world, that I <a href="about.html">enjoy</a> spending time in, and the world of computing.
